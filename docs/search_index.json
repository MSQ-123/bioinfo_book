You can download the github version locally and render it on your PC. This short book (actually, study notes) introduces some of my bioinformatics practice in cooperation with members of professional IT team (Note: this notebook has yet to be finished). 1.1 Purpose for writing I am a big fan of R and computational biology. Research in computational biology should involve innovations that could tweak classic theory and transform it into real-life application (medical treatment, clinical trial, drug discovery, etc.). As global challenge right now is fighting against COVID-19, our team aimed to provide an integrative resource, not only focusing on SARS-CoV-2, but also applicable in future research regarding other viruses. Overall, I think a data schemas is instructive. I hope this notebook would develop into a resource that will grow and change over time as a living book (tracking my knowledge footprints). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github, I recommend downloading the lastest released instead of CRAN repos, since the CRAN version can sometimes make you frustrated (Do not ask how I know). install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) 1.2 About me Iâ€™m a big fan of R and data science, also interested in python, java (I plan to systematically learn it), front-end js and back-end SQL (I enjoy using dplyr in R, somehow like using SQL interface). I have developed two R packages either seriously( CovidMutations ) or for fun( chromseq ). I have writen some articles on jianshu platform last year (2020, when I was a junior student in Xiamen University), talking about some of my experiences in bioinformatics. For biological scope, I have a broad interest in developmental epigenomics, machine learning in biomedicine, and novel NGS methods (my undergraduate thesis titled: RNA-seq library construction using low cellular input and evaluation of single-cell data analysis pipeline).
